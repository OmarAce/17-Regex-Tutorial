# RegEx Tutoral

Regex, or Regular Expression Syntax, is a useful tool for any web developer. Regular Expressions define a search pattern and are very useful for form input validation, web scraping, and filtering information. Regex may appear intimidating initially, but they can be broken down into smaller components so they can be more easily understood.

## Summary

Perhaps regex's greatest use case is in form validation. For instance, the following regular expression can be used to verify that user input is a valid email address:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

**Note:** Each component of this regex has a unique responsibility to make sure that a user enters an email address that begins with an unspecified number of characters preceding the `@` symbol, followed by a domain.
